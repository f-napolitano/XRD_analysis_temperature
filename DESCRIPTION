Description: This package takes all the diffraction patterns (Panalytical .xrdml format) stored in a directory and for each one of them identify a certain Bragg peak and calculates reflection 2theta position, intensity, area, and integral breadth. Store the results in an output file and the resulting plot in a png file.
